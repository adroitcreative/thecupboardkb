  We enjoy educating customers about cabinetry and design.  We take the time with our customers to make sure they understand what will be involved in the cabinet design process, discuss all of their cabinetry options and provide initial design suggestions.  There is a lot of necessary information to be aware of before purchasing and creating your dream cabinet design.  Have you asked yourself the following questions yet?

    - How will you use your new kitchen?  Socially or for quick meals?
    - What appliances will you use?
    - What are the positives/negatives of your current kitchen?
    - What is your budget?

  These are some of the questions that we can help guide you through to make the process easy and enjoyable.   Our design team members are experts in cabinet design, interior design and have a background of over 40 years in construction.  To get the process started please review and fill out our <design wishlist> to bring to your first design meeting with us!  We can’t wait to meet with you!

  Our staff will go to the job site or your home and will take all of the necessary measurements to draft a cabinet layout for you.  It is also helpful for you to take your own measurements and do a rough sketch prior to your first design meeting.  Make sure to measure all of the following for any space that is being remodeled.  Sometimes secondary measurements are needed further along in the design process as new changes are made to the design.  (ie. if you decide to knock down walls, etc.)

    - Window & door frame (width & height)
    - Ceiling (height)
    - Appliance dimensions (width, height & depth)
    - Room dimensions

  Our professional designers provide you with original designs that include your wish list.  The designs will be a combination of what was discussed in your design meetings and our combined creativity.
  We will meet with you as many times as needed to finalize your design.  In follow-up consultations you can expect the following from our dedicated staff…
  
    - Finalize design details including all changes needed.
